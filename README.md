Tools for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format

This project aims to create a Java library for the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) of the W3C.  

## Current features
* read a SVG as a DOM document and build the corresponding Java SVG model
* render the Java SVG model on a Java Graphics object
* render in a Java Swing component (for desktop apps) and manage events

## Disclaimer

Job is sill in progress and the library will be improved as necessary over the time.
There are many bugs to fix, many missing things and many enhancements to do as SVG is very rich and complex.
